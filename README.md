# Python Libraries Examples with Google Colab

This repository contains examples of how to use various Python libraries for data analysis and visualization in Google Colab.

## Libraries

- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/): Numerical computing library.
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/): Data manipulation and analysis library.
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/): Data visualization library.
- [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/): Machine learning library.
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/): Statistical data visualization library.

## Google Colab

All examples are designed to be run in Google Colab, a free, cloud-based Jupyter notebook environment that allows you to write and execute Python code.

## Usage

Each Python notebook in this repository demonstrates the usage of a specific library:

- `Numpy_Examples.ipynb`: NumPy example.
- `Pandas_Examples.ipynb`: pandas example.
- `Matplotlib_Examples.ipynb`: matplotlib example.
- `Scikit_learn_Examples.ipynb`: scikit-learn example.
- `Seaborn_Examples.ipynb`: seaborn example.

To run these examples in Google Colab, simply upload the notebook to your Google Drive and open it with Google Colab.

Feel free to explore the examples and experiment with the libraries.
